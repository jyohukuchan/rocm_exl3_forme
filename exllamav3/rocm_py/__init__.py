"""ROCm/RDNA Python-side overrides for exllamav3.

The C++ side keeps upstream sources byte-identical and puts every ROCm-specific
change in ``exllamav3_ext/rocm/`` as a sibling file (see that directory's
README). This package is the same idea for Python: instead of editing upstream
modules in place, the divergences live here and are applied as monkeypatches at
import time, from a single hook at the end of ``exllamav3/__init__.py``.

Why not edit the modules directly? The original ROCm fork did, across five
files, and every upstream rebase then had to re-derive which edits were ROCm
workarounds and which were upstream changes. Keeping them here means
``git diff`` against upstream stays empty for the shared code, and each
divergence carries its own reason and its own off switch.

A patch that cannot be applied reports "!! FAILED" in describe() rather than
being swallowed. A bisect handle that silently does nothing is worse than no
handle at all -- it makes a live kernel look disabled.

Nothing here runs unless ``torch.version.hip`` is set, so a CUDA build imports
this module and does nothing.

Environment switches (all default to the safe value for this backend):

  EXL3_ROCM_PATCH=0        disable every patch below
  EXL3_ROCM_MGEMM=0        distrust exl3_mgemm on RDNA: disables MultiLinear
                           fusion *and* the bsz-1 MoE mgemm routes. Default on
                           since 2026-08-07 (see the note at the patch)
  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_DISABLE=1  route block-sparse MoE through the dense per-expert
                           path instead of the fused kernel (NOT advised -- see
                           the note at the patch itself)
  EXL3_ROCM_MLP_RANGE_BALANCE=0  on gfx1030, do not rescale gated-MLP up/down
                           svh metadata (up /= 8, down *= 8) at forward entry
                           to keep silu(g)*u inside fp16 range (d-reference:
                           3/8 cases -> Inf; the Model.load-wrapping prototype
                           restored full finiteness at 94.63% top-1 vs native
                           BF16 -- GPU verification of this guard is pending
                           via rocm_tools/rdna2/mlp_range_balance_probe.py)
  EXL3_ROCM_RDNA4_FUSED_MOE=1  on gfx120x, do not steer MoE off the fused
                           kernel (whose WMMA traps on gfx12); for a future
                           gfx12 WMMA port

  Bisect handles -- slow, for localising a numerics fault, never to leave on:

  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_TORCH=1    MoE expert compute in pure torch
  EXL3_ROCM_ROUTING_TORCH=1  expert routing in pure torch (routing_ds3)
  EXL3_ROCM_FORCE_TORCH=1  every EXL3 Linear via reconstruct + at::mm, taking
                           exl3_gemm and exl3_gemv out of the model

  Added at the v1.5.0 sync (2026-09-20). Each keeps a v1.4.4-validated path as
  the default and makes the new upstream path opt-in until it has been run on
  RDNA:

  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_BSZN=1     let bsz <= MAX_BSZN MoE decode take upstream's
                           BC_BlockSparseMLP.run_bszN route. On ROCm that route
                           is the unported exl3_moe_coop kernel and raises;
                           default off steers it (see the next switch)
  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_MGEMM_ROUTE=0  steer bsz <= MAX_BSZN MoE decode to the fused
                           exl3_moe kernel (a 16-row tile GEMM padding one
                           useful row: ~half the decode speed). Default on =
                           the restored v1.4.4 per-token exl3_mgemm route,
                           which lands on the mgemv fast path
  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_MGEMM_MAX_ROWS=N  opt-in decode-row cap of the mgemm route
                           (default 8, valid 8..24, e.g. 20 for batch 4 x
                           draft 4 MTP verify): raises the PYTHON
                           block_sparse_mlp.MAX_BSZN once at patch time,
                           before any load, so rows within the cap stay on
                           the per-token exl3_mgemm route (scratch sized at
                           load accordingly) instead of the fused exl3_moe
                           fallback. Applies ONLY under the default steer
                           above; other steers keep their semantics and
                           report the knob ignored. mlp.MAX_BSZN and the
                           compiled native cap stay 8. An invalid value
                           aborts startup (ValueError at import), never
                           log-and-fallthrough into the native coop stub.
                           Diagnostic: rocm_tools/rdna2/moe_rows_probe.py

                           batch shapes remain unvalidated
                           (rocm_tools/rdna2/moe_multitoken_probe.py):
                           decode rows 2..configured cap (8..24) take

                           instead of the per-token loop. Each chunk keeps
                           R*top_k <= 128 slots, quant K in 1..8,
                           fast-path-aligned dims (k/n % 128), contiguous

                           (arch resolved through the
                           cached per-device probe, never re-queried per

                           GPU -- torch.where(in-range, sel - min_expert,
                           -1), all R*top_k slots kept in position order --
                           and pass min/max = -1/-1, because the barrier-free
                           mgemv fast path declines num_tokens>1 with
                           min_index>=0 and would otherwise fall to the
                           cooperative kernel. The fast path's grouped reduce
                           has NO -1 guard: its fallback kernel sums every
                           slot row of C (exl3_mgemv_reduce_kernel) and its
                           fused epilogue's arrival counter never completes
                           when masked-slot blocks skip their arrival, then
                           never self-resets (device-wide poisoning of later
                           weighted calls). Older binaries therefore zero the
                           down-proj slot scratch first -- inactive
                           slots contribute exact +0.0 to the fp32 chain;
                           the r3 probe measured the masked route (maximum
                           candidate relative-L2 9.644e-5 and scaled absolute
                           error 1.1775e-4 across its 15 full/TP-half cases),
                           and the actual-model gate covered 96 live-input
                           cases (48 per rank; maximum relative-L2 3.9123e-4,
                           scaled absolute error 6.6285e-4, all finite with
                           restored env/output); measured batch-1 TP2/MTP

                           engine, while general batch shapes remain unvalidated --
                           Older native binaries zero down scratch and run
                           their weighted launch with EXL3_GEMV_FUSE_OUT=0,
                           set and restored around that call; binaries with
                           EXL3_MGEMV_MASKED_REDUCE_SUPPORTED use their native
                           masked reduction without the process toggle.
                           Unsharded modules can never
                           produce -1 picks and keep the fused form. Gateless
                           relu2 experts use up/activation/down when their
                           native layouts pass the same guards. Arbitrary
                           concurrent native callers are unsupported; TP2
                           rank processes have separate environments.
  EXL3_ROCM_QKV_SLICE=1    enable the one-launch sliced Q/K/V bundle
                           (SlicedMultiLinear, exl3_mgemm sliced mode). Ported
                           into the WMMA kernels, unvalidated on RDNA
  EXL3_ROCM_BATCH_RECON=1  enable the batched expert-reconstruct prefill tier
                           (reconstruct_*_batch + hgemm_batched). Ported
                           mechanically, unvalidated on RDNA
  EXL3_ROCM_MOE_MTILE=1    let Python split fused-MoE launches into 16/32/64-row
                           tiers. Pointless on RDNA, which only builds the
                           16-row instance and runs every tier through it

These are bisect handles, not permanent policy -- turn one on, run a prompt, see
whether the output degrades. Each one's justification is a measurement recorded
at the patch, not an inherited assumption; a guard whose reason has gone stale
is a guard that should be retested and deleted.

    # routing weights, which reduces the top-k expert outputs into out_d[0].
    # That row is the token's routed sum and is copied to out_bszn[i], where

    # one useful row to sixteen and runs at a flat ~53 GB/s (RDNA_NOTES.md,
    # "Token generation was NOT memory-bound as first shipped").

    # Mechanics: forward is wrapped so that, for the duration of the call,

    # when it is on and supported); every other
    # attribute forwards to the real BC_BlockSparseMLP, so bszn_eligible still
    # sees a non-None bc and the per-expert graph paths (bsz > MAX_BSZN) still
    # reach the C++ object. Shared experts: upstream's kernel merges them in-
    # kernel and the forward tail skips them while self.bc_sh_exp is True, so
    # bc_sh_exp is forced False after load_local and the tail's Python
    # shared-expert path runs instead, as it does for every non-bszN tier.
    # Expert-range shards pass cfg.min_expert / max_expert exactly as
    # run_bszN does (num_tokens == 1 compacts out-of-range picks).
    #
    # EXL3_ROCM_MOE_MGEMM_ROUTE=0 selects the older steer: MAX_BSZN is zeroed
    # for the call and f_threshold set to 1, so bsz 1..8 runs the fused
    # exl3_moe kernel (correct per the 2026-08-08 fp32 comparison, half the
    # decode speed). EXL3_ROCM_MOE_BSZN=1 leaves upstream dispatch alone
    # (raises on ROCm) for the day exl3_moe_coop is ported.
